This project is a personal data science exercise focused on estimating the total CO₂ emissions of the use phase of a cosmetic product, considering its usage during a shower.

The use phase is modeled using a Monte Carlo simulation, accounting for user behavior and variability in key parameters such as:

**- Shower duration**
**- Emission factor for water supply**
**- Emission factor for heating energy**

The objective is to capture the range and distribution of carbon emissions, rather than relying on a single average value.

📄 The detailed methodology, assumptions, and results are available in use_phase_exercice.pdf.

💻 The full implementation and simulations are provided in use_phase.ipynb.
