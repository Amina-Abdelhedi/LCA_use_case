📌 Project Overview

This project is a personal data science exercise aimed at estimating the total CO₂ emissions of the use phase of a cosmetic product, considering its usage during a shower.

The use phase is modeled using a Monte Carlo simulation with 1,000 runs, capturing behavioral variability and uncertainty in key parameters such as:

**- Shower duration**

**- Emission factor for water supply**

**- Emission factor for heating energy**

The objective is to analyze the distribution and range of carbon emissions, rather than relying on a single average value.

📄 A detailed explanation of the methodology and results is available in use_phase.pdf.

💻 The full simulation code is provided in use_phase.ipynb.
